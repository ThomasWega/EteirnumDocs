# Skills

Each node can have an array of skills associated with it, defining the actions or abilities unlocked when the node is activated. Each skill in the array is defined by several properties:

* `bind-id`: A unique identifier for the skill binding.&#x20;
  * This ID is used to recognize the progress and skill selection in the node
* `type`: The type of the skill, usually indicating what kind of ability or action it is.&#x20;
  * All types are listed as subpages of this page
